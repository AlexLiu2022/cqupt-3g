## The News

It is reported that Chongqing Heavy Post Technology Co., LTD. (hereinafter referred to as "Heavy Post Technology"), which is controlled by Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, has recently developed the "Tongxin No. 1" chip with China's independent intellectual property rights. It is the world's first TD-SCDMA mobile phone baseband chip using 0.13 micron process, with low power consumption, small core size and low cost, marking that the key technology of China's 3G communication core chip has reached the world's leading level.

## The Chip

"Tongxin-1" chip is a mobile phone chip independently developed in accordance with 3GPP TD-SCDMA standard. It has excellent overall architecture and implementation algorithm, has been fully simulated and verified, and has extremely high performance and stability. It can complete all processing work of TD-SCDMA mobile phone physical layer, protocol stack and application software.



## The Success

The successful development of "Tongxin No. 1" chip of Chongpost and Telecommunications Department is another major breakthrough in TD-SCDMA independent innovation after the University of Posts and Telecommunications began to participate in the TD-SCDMA standard research led by Datang Telecom in 1998, and independently developed the world's first TD-SCDMA (TSM) mobile phone in 2003 using a universal chip. It is a major contribution to the industrialization of TD-SCDMA, marking that the company has established an important basic position in the TD-SCDMA terminal industry chain.
